# TakaTech AI 

**Intelligent Waste Management for Sustainable Agriculture**  

TakaTech AI is an AI-powered waste management platform designed to transform agricultural market waste into organic fertilizer. By integrating deep learning, IoT sensors, and real-time analytics, it reduces methane emissions and supports Kenya’s Climate Smart Agriculture and 2030 emission reduction targets.

## 1. What problem are you solving?  

Agricultural markets in Kenya generate massive organic waste that is poorly managed, leading to:  

- **Environmental Impact:** Methane emissions from decomposing waste  
- **Economic Loss:** Valuable organic matter is discarded  
- **Sustainability Gap:** Lack of circular economy systems  
- **Climate Goals:** Difficulty meeting Kenya’s 32% emission reduction target by 2030  

---

## 2. What is your solution?  

**TakaTech AI** provides an AI-driven, easy-to-use platform that:  

- Categorizes waste into decomposable matter (for composting)  
- Predicts methane emissions based on waste characteristics and suggests mitigation strategies  
- Calculates and displays the amount of carbon emissions mitigated for each action  
- Converts waste into valuable organic fertilizer, closing the agricultural input loop

## 3. Who are your users and what is the impact?  

**Users:**  
- Market operators  
- Smallholder farmers  
- Environmental agencies  
- Agricultural cooperatives  

**Impact:**  
- Significant methane emission reductions from markets  
- Displays **carbon emissions mitigated (kg CO₂e)** directly in the recommendations, allowing users to track their environmental impact  
- Cost savings through organic fertilizer and livestock feed production  
- New green economy jobs and improved food security  
- Direct contribution to Kenya's Climate Smart Agriculture Strategy and NDC goals
